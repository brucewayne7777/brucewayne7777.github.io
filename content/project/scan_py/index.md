This project is a Python-based document scanner that uses OpenCV to automatically detect document boundaries and create a top-down perspective view. It serves as a hands-on learning experience for computer vision fundamentals, including image processing techniques like edge detection, contour finding, and perspective transforms.

### Features
*   **Automatic document detection** using edge detection and contour analysis
*   **Perspective correction** to get a top-down view of documents
*   **Image enhancement** with adaptive thresholding for better readability
*   **Real-time visualization** of each processing step

This project is an implementation based on Adrian Rosebrock's tutorial from PyImageSearch.
